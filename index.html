        I grew up in a small town by the Mississippi named Princeton, IA. As I grew older, I became increasingly fascinated by the intersection of sports and business, which led me to pursue a degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems with a minor in Sports and Recreation Management.

        Throughout my academic journey, I've gained valuable experience working in various fields, including working as a cook in my early days, then being a construction wireman, and the insurance industry as a Business Analyst. Each of these roles has taught me valuable lessons about hard work, customer service, and teamwork, all of which I believe will serve me well in my future career.
        
        In my free time, I'm an avid sports fan and love nothing more than spending time with friends watching the game. Whether it's football, basketball, or baseball, there's always a match to catch, and I'm always up for it.
        
        Overall, I'm excited to continue exploring the worlds of business and sports, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next.
